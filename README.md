# PersonalBlacklist 

Tired of getting in groups (Guilds, Raid, Mythics +) with undesirable people on it? This is the solution!
 
The Personal Blacklist or PBL gives you the possibility to store the names of those undesirable players and categorize them.
 
How this helps you ? The PBL also gives you the possibility to see on your LFG and Player Tooltips a little warning that they are on your list and not just that also the PBL has an internal functionality that if you get in a group with a player, that's part of your list will show you a Warning mentioning that player and giving you the possibility to leave the group before your activity starts.
 
When this Add-on is useful? Literally on any part of the game that includes matching with people that you don't know as Mythics +, Raids, Guilds , World & PvP.
 
How to use it ? You can toggle the PBL UI by clicking your new minimap icon or by writing on your chat /pbl , as soon you see your new interface,you just need to insert the name of the person in the current format:  Name-Realm, pick a category ,a reason and a class for your ban and that's it that person now will be included on your Personal Blacklist.
 
How to copy a weird name into the PBL ? Right Click the player portrait or chat name and select the option Give PBL Ban or simple toggle your chat and shift+click on the name of the person on the chat and you will get his name and realm on it , simply copy and paste that into your PBL.
Name Format:  name-realm (Example: Xylons-Illidan)
 
List of commands:

/pbl config = to open pbl configurations
/pbl chatfilter = Adds a chat identifier to people that you have on your banned list.
